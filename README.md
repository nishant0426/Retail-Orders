# ðŸ›’ Retail Orders Analysis (Python + PostgreSQL)

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes retail order data by extracting raw data from Kaggle, transforming it using Python (Pandas), and loading it into PostgreSQL for structured analytics. The objective is to clean, model, and generate insights on sales performance across products, categories, and regions.

## Tech Stack  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** â€“ Data cleaning & transformation  
- **PostgreSQL (SQL queries, CTEs, Window Functions, Joins)** â€“ Data storage & analytics  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Data analysis & visualization  
- **Kaggle API** â€“ Data extraction  

## Data Source  
- Dataset: [Retail Orders Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders) (downloaded using Kaggle API)  
- File: `orders.csv`  

##  Features / Highlights  
- Automated **data extraction** from Kaggle API.  
- Data cleaning & transformation with Pandas (handling missing values, data type conversions, formatting).  
- Loaded transformed data into PostgreSQL for structured querying.  
- Performed advanced SQL analytics, including:  
  - Top 10 highest revenue-generating products  
  - Top 5 best-selling products by region  
  - Month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs 2023)  
  - Highest sales month per category  
  - Sub-category with highest profit growth between 2022 & 2023  
- Combined **Python + SQL pipeline** for end-to-end data analytics.
